abstract: "This paper presents the work of the CLOSE group, a team of students from the University of Padua, Italy, for the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) LongEval LAB 2023 Task 1. Our work involved developing an Information Retrieval (IR) system that can handle changes in data over time while maintaining high performance. We first introduce the problem as stated by CLEF and then describe our system, explaining the different methodologies we implemented. We provide the results of our experiments and analyze them based on the choices we made regarding various techniques. Finally, we propose potential avenues for future improvement of our system."
methodology: "Our approach consisted of using a combination of different techniques, including query expansion, re-ranking, and the use of large language models such as ChatGPT and SBERT."

In their participation at CLEF 2023, the CLOSE team from the University of Padua tackled the crucial problem of temporal persistence in Information Retrieval (IR) systemsâ€”where performance tends to degrade as data and user queries evolve. Their system was designed to adapt to these changes while maintaining consistent retrieval effectiveness. They created a flexible IR system using a range of sophisticated methodologies, such as advanced document parsing to eliminate unnecessary noise, indexing processes that streamline information for optimal search performance, and an innovative approach to query expansion via AI models. A key innovation was re-ranking retrieved documents based on BM25 and deep learning-based sentence transformers, ensuring high-quality retrieval results. Their work highlights the importance of long-term system adaptability in dynamic environments like the web, offering valuable insights and laying the foundation for future advancements in IR performance over time.
